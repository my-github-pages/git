# Note for me
* git push --follow-tags
* git tag -a

### head/master x(3) commits back. It is head now github pages shows it! (please test!)
* git branch # or tag to mark the path. So it is not deleted.
* push remote!
* git reset --hard head~3 # zur√ºck

The old tree is now a branch or tag?

# Note for all
* git status

# Questions
If we done something wrong does github delete direkt? Or x days. And reflog is your friend?
