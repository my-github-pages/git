# Note for me
* git push --follow-tags
* git tag -a
* git fetch; git diff origin/master 

### head/master x(3) commits back. It is head now github pages shows it! (please test!)
* git branch # or tag to mark the path. So it is not deleted.
* push remote branch or tag?
* git reset --hard head~3 # zur√ºck

The old tree is now a branch or tag?

# Note for all
* see: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 
* git status
* git add . ; git commit -m "What was the idea of this change?" 
* git push

# Questions
If we done something wrong does github delete direkt? Or x days. And reflog is your friend?
